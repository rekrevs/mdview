# T-0003: Set default window height to 80% of display

**Status**: DONE
**Phase**: IMPLEMENTING
**After**: —
**Before**: —

## Context

The default window size is too small. User wants the window to default to 80% of the display height for better readability of markdown documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] New windows open at 80% of screen height
- [x] Window width should be proportional (reasonable aspect ratio)
- [x] Window should be centered or positioned sensibly

## Verification Plan

### Tests to Create
| Test | Proves | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Manual: Launch app | Window is ~80% screen height | - |

### Regression Check
```
swift build
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Launch app, verify window height is approximately 80% of screen

## Approach

Use `.defaultSize()` modifier on DocumentGroup with dimensions calculated from `NSScreen.main`.

1. Get screen size from `NSScreen.main?.visibleFrame`
2. Calculate height as 80% of screen height
3. Calculate width with reasonable aspect ratio (e.g., 2:3 or based on screen width)
4. Apply via `.defaultSize(width:height:)` on the DocumentGroup

## Implementation Notes

### PLANNING
- DocumentGroup supports .defaultSize(width:height:) modifier
- Need to calculate from NSScreen.main at app launch
- Will use visibleFrame to account for menu bar/dock

### TESTING_RED

### IMPLEMENTING
- Added .defaultSize() modifier to DocumentGroup
- Height: 80% of NSScreen.main.visibleFrame.height
- Width: 50% of screen width, clamped to 600-1000px

### TESTING_GREEN

### REFACTORING

### DEBUGGING

## Obstacles

## Evidence

- User confirmed window size is good

## Outcome

Added dynamic window sizing based on screen dimensions. Windows now open at 80% screen height with proportional width.
